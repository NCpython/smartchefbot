```bash
cd /Users/nishantchaturvedi/Desktop/fnb-intelligence

# Initialize Git
git init

# Add all files (venv will be excluded automatically!)
git add .

# Verify venv is NOT in the list
git status

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: SmartChefBot ready for Railway deployment"

# Create a new repository on GitHub, then:
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/smartchefbot.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway:

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Login with GitHub
3. New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo
4. Choose your `smartchefbot` repository

## ✅ Pre-Push Checklist

Before you push to GitHub, verify:

- [ ] Your Google Gemini API key is ready
- [ ] You have a GitHub account
- [ ] You're in the project directory
- [ ] Run `git status` and verify `venv/` is NOT listed

---

## 🔍 What .gitignore Excludes

The following will NOT be committed to Git (as intended):

- `venv/` - Your virtual environment (10,515 files!)
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache directories
- `.env` - Your local environment file with secrets
- `data/menus/*.pdf` - Uploaded PDF files
- `data/extracted/*.json` - Extracted menu data
- `.DS_Store` - macOS system files
- `.vscode/`, `.idea/` - IDE settings

---

## 📊 What WILL Be Committed

These files will go to GitHub:

✅ All source code (`server.py`, `agent/`, `api/`, etc.)  
✅ `requirements.txt`  
✅ `README.md` and documentation  
✅ `railway.json` configuration  
✅ `.gitignore` itself  
✅ Empty data directories (via `.gitkeep`)  
✅ `LICENSE` file  

**Total size:** ~1-2 MB (instead of ~500 MB with venv!)

---

## 🎯 What Happens After Push

### On GitHub:
- Your code will be visible
- Others can clone and contribute
- Version control for all changes

### On Railway:
- Automatic detection of Python project
- Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Starts server with `uvicorn server:app`
- Provides HTTPS URL
- Auto-deploys on every Git push

---

## 💡 Railway Environment Variables Needed

You'll add these in Railway dashboard (NOT in Git!):

| Variable | Value | Required |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Your Gemini API key | ✅ Yes |
| `PORT` | Auto-set by Railway | ✅ Auto |

---

## 🧪 Test Locally Before Deploy (Optional)

Want to test the PORT configuration works locally?

```bash
cd /Users/nishantchaturvedi/Desktop/fnb-intelligence
source venv/bin/activate

# Test with custom port
export PORT=8080
python server.py

# Should start on port 8080
# Open: http://localhost:8080
```

---

## 📱 After Deployment - Share With Your Team

Once deployed, share these URLs:

**Web Interface:**
- Home: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
- Chat: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/chat`
- Data: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/data`

**API Documentation:**
- Swagger UI: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/docs`
- ReDoc: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/redoc`
- OpenAPI: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/openapi.json`

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

After first deploy, your workflow becomes:

```bash
# 1. Make changes to your code
vim server.py

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
git push

# 3. Railway automatically deploys! ✨
# No manual steps needed!
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "venv appears in git status"
**Solution:** Double-check `.gitignore` was created properly

### Issue: "Build failed on Railway"
**Solution:** Check Railway logs, verify requirements.txt, test locally first

### Issue: "App starts but returns 500 error"
**Solution:** Check GOOGLE_API_KEY is set in Railway environment variables

### Issue: "Port already in use locally"
**Solution:** Change port: `export PORT=8080 && python server.py`
